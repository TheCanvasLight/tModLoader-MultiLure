[h1]MultiLure is a mod that adds a configurable number of lures while fishing and allows you to carry up to 99 quest fish in your inventory.[/h1]

MultiLure now includes fishing line accessories for those who don't like cheating. (Thanks to Dark Dragoon's Multi Lure Accessories mod for the idea!) [b]Note:[/b] if a quest fish is in your inventory when you cast, you still can't catch any more than what you're already carrying. Drop the existing fish or put it in a chest and try again.
